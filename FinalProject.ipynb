    "Late in the project, we found that our combine data only went through 2018.  This was a major blocker as we wanted to use recent data for analysis.  We scrubbed data from a reputable website and created a new combine file.  Using Data Wrangler for convenience, we performed all the transformation/cleaning steps outlined above and uploaded the completed file to S3.  We will use that file for modeling.
